/// A simple material design dialog.
///
/// Edited to use [KeyboardAwareDialog].
/// Moves up when soft keyboard is shown and scrollable when there's
/// not enough vertical space.
///
/// All the arguments are identical to [SimpleDialog].
///
/// Note: `barrierDismissible` of [showDialog] will have no effect, you
/// can't dismiss dialog by clicking the outside of the dialog.
///
/// A simple dialog offers the user a choice between several options. A simple
/// dialog has an optional title that is displayed above the choices.
///
/// Choices are normally represented using [SimpleDialogOption] widgets. If
/// other widgets are used, see [contentPadding] for notes regarding the
/// conventions for obtaining the spacing expected by Material Design.
///
/// For dialogs that inform the user about a situation, consider using an
/// [AlertDialog].
///
/// Typically passed as the child widget to [showDialog], which displays the
/// dialog.
///
/// {@animation 350 622 https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/simple_dialog.mp4}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// In this example, the user is asked to select between two options. These
/// options are represented as an enum. The [showDialog] method here returns
/// a [Future] that completes to a value of that enum. If the user cancels
/// the dialog (e.g. by hitting the back button on Android, or tapping on the
/// mask behind the dialog) then the future completes with the null value.
///
/// The return value in this example is used as the index for a switch statement.
/// One advantage of using an enum as the return value and then using that to
/// drive a switch statement is that the analyzer will flag any switch statement
/// that doesn't mention every value in the enum.
///
